# Woo Commerce Add Invoice/Receipt Fields(Full Guide)
Woo Commerce Add Invoice/Receipt Fields To Cart +fields for info if selection is invoice

Came across a problem:
A client wanted a custom dropdown selection at the Woo Cart, for single receipt or invoice, 
If the user selects Invoice, a new custom field should pop up to enter the client's company info,
a must have to my client for printing invoices having the proper info to pring.

I looked over the internet and couldn't find a "straight away" solution, so i came up with mine:

Through functions.php, i added two custom fields in the Woo Commerce Cart: one dropdown 
selection and one textbox. Making the proper conditions by code, i managed to show the custom field 
only when Invoice is selected. 
Done? No!
I had to show the info entered by the user in the Woo Commerce Order in Wordpress,
plus in all the emails that were sent at the Customer and at the E-shop's admin.
Done?Yes.

Holla at me if you want something custom done, or help with my codes, or even to say hello.
Happy coding!
